Copyright (c) 1990-2008 Info-ZIP - Type 'zip "-L"' for software license.
Zip 3.0 (July 5th 2008). Usage:
zip [-options] [-b path] [-t mmddyyyy] [-n suffixes] [zipfile list] [-xi list]
  The default action is to add or replace zipfile entries from list, which
  can include the special name - to compress standard input.
  If zipfile and list are omitted, zip compresses stdin to stdout.
  -f   freshen: only changed files  -u   update: only changed or new files
  -d   delete entries in zipfile    -m   move into zipfile (delete OS files)
  -r   recurse into directories     -j   junk (don't record) directory names
  -0   store only                   -l   convert LF to CR LF (-ll CR LF to LF)
  -1   compress faster              -9   compress better
  -q   quiet operation              -v   verbose operation/print version info
  -c   add one-line comments        -z   add zipfile comment
  -@   read names from stdin        -o   make zipfile as old as latest entry
  -x   exclude the following names  -i   include only the following names
  -F   fix zipfile (-FF try harder) -D   do not add directory entries
  -A   adjust self-extracting exe   -J   junk zipfile prefix (unzipsfx)
  -T   test zipfile integrity       -X   eXclude eXtra file attributes
  -y   store symbolic links as the link instead of the referenced file
  -e   encrypt                      -n   don't compress these suffixes

zip -r -u -9 -v /home/pi/Desktop/chromium_backup.zip /home/pi/.config/chromium/Default



UnZip 6.00 of 20 April 2009, by Debian. Original by Info-ZIP.
Usage: unzip [-Z] [-opts[modifiers]] file[.zip] [list] [-x xlist] [-d exdir]
  Default action is to extract files in list, except those in xlist, to exdir;
  file[.zip] may be a wildcard.  -Z => ZipInfo mode ("unzip -Z" for usage).

  -p  extract files to pipe, no messages     -l  list files (short format)
  -f  freshen existing files, create none    -t  test compressed archive data
  -u  update files, create if necessary      -z  display archive comment only
  -v  list verbosely/show version info       -T  timestamp archive to latest
  -x  exclude files that follow (in xlist)   -d  extract files into exdir
modifiers:
  -n  never overwrite existing files         -q  quiet mode (-qq => quieter)
  -o  overwrite files WITHOUT prompting      -a  auto-convert any text files
  -j  junk paths (do not make directories)   -aa treat ALL files as text
  -U  use escapes for all non-ASCII Unicode  -UU ignore any Unicode fields
  -C  match filenames case-insensitively     -L  make (some) names lowercase
  -X  restore UID/GID info                   -V  retain VMS version numbers
  -K  keep setuid/setgid/tacky permissions   -M  pipe through "more" pager
See "unzip -hh" or unzip.txt for more help.  Examples:
  unzip data1 -x joe   => extract all files except joe from zipfile data1.zip
  unzip -p foo | more  => send contents of foo.zip via pipe into program more
  unzip -fo foo ReadMe => quietly replace existing ReadMe if archive file newer

unzip -u -o -v /home/pi/Desktop/chromium_backup.zip -d /home/pi/.config/chromium/


To fix sch/ssh issues, edit:
notepad C:\Users\u\.ssh\known_hosts 


FROM:
cd somewhere
scp -p -v pi@10.0.0.6:/home/pi/Desktop/chromium_backup.zip .

TO:
cd somewhere
scp -p -v chromium_backup.zip pi@10.0.0.6:/home/pi/Desktop/

The `scp` command has several options, each serving a different purpose. Here is a list of common `scp` options and their meanings:
- `-3` : Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local host.
- `-4` : Forces `scp` to use IPv4 addresses only.
- `-6` : Forces `scp` to use IPv6 addresses only.
- `-A` : Allows forwarding of the authentication agent connection.
- `-B` : Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or passphrases).
- `-C` : Compression enabled.
- `-c cipher` : Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.
- `-D sftp_server_path` : Specifies the path to the sftp server on the remote host.
- `-F ssh_config` : Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for SSH.
- `-i identity_file` : Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read.
- `-J destination` : Connects to the target host by first making a SSH connection to the jump host described by `destination` and then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.
- `-l limit` : Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.
- `-O` : Use the legacy `scp` protocol.
- `-o ssh_option` : Can be used to pass options to `ssh` in the format used in `ssh_config`.
- `-P port` : Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
- `-p` : Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file.
- `-q` : Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and diagnostic messages from `ssh`.
- `-r` : Recursively copy entire directories.
- `-S program` : Name of program to use for the encrypted connection.
- `-T` : Disables strict filename checking.
- `-v` : Verbose mode. Causes `scp` and `ssh` to print debugging messages about their progress.
- `-X sftp_option` : Specifies an option for the sftp client. 

For your use case, you likely won't need to use many of these options. If you simply want to copy a file from a remote host to your local machine, you might use a command like:
scp pi@10.0.0.6:/home/pi/Desktop/chromium_backup.zip .

- **Basic File Copy:**
  scp user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/destination

- **Copy Directory Recursively:**
  scp -r user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory /path/to/local/destination

- **Specify Port:**
  scp -P 2222 user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/destination

- **Use Identity File (Private Key):**
  scp -i /path/to/private/key user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/destination

- **Verbose Mode:**
  scp -v user@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/destination

These examples should help you understand how to use `scp` effectively for transferring files. If you have specific requirements or face any issues, feel free to ask!
